      "\n",
      "1. **Predictive Analytics**: Utilizing machine learning algorithms, the AI could analyze vast amounts of data from various sources (e.g., electronic health records, genomics databases) to forecast patient outcomes, identify high-risk patients, and recommend personalized treatment plans.\n",
      "2. **Treatment Optimization**: By continuously updating the AI's understanding of individualized medicine principles, the system could optimize treatment regimens based on real-time feedback from medical imaging tests, lab results, or other data feeds.\n",
      "3. **Patient Engagement and Education**: An Agentic AI could develop user-centered interfaces to educate patients about their personalized health trajectories, encouraging them to take more active roles in managing their conditions.\n",
      "4. **Collaborative Care Model**: The system could facilitate seamless communication between healthcare providers, enabling a more integrated care team to make informed decisions that cater to the patient's unique needs.\n",

      "In this context, Agentic AI would:\n",
      "\n",

      "* Continuously learn from high-quality data sources\n",
